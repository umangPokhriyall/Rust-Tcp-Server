# Architecture — Rust-Tcp-Server

A benchmark teardown of TCP server I/O models, from an `accept()`-in-a-loop to a
purpose-built `io_uring` completion engine, built behind one `Server` trait. The
governing constraint is that the HTTP work lives in exactly one place — the
sans-IO `core` crate — and every one of the eleven concurrency models reuses it
unchanged. This document describes the four-layer design that makes that hold,
the per-layer contracts, the evidence that one frozen `core` served all eleven
models, and the key design decisions with the alternatives they rejected.

## 1. Layering

Four layers, dependencies pointing downward only. The sans-IO boundary is the
line above which no code touches a socket.

`core` depends on nothing in the project. `sys` depends on `libc` and `core`'s
types but performs no protocol logic. `reactor` assembles `sys` primitives and
drives a `core::Connection`. Each `models/` module selects one concurrency
strategy and reuses everything beneath it. No layer reaches upward.

## 2. Per-layer contracts

### `core/` — the sans-IO protocol library

- **Owns:** the HTTP request parser (`http::request`), response encoder
  (`http::response`), trie router (`router`), in-memory asset cache (`asset`),
  the per-connection `Connection` state machine and its `ConnAction` contract
  (`conn`), the `Server` trait and `ServerConfig` (`server`), bounded-input
  ceilings (`limits`), and atomic metrics (`metrics`).
- **Must never:** call `read`, `write`, `accept`, `epoll`, or any other
  per-connection syscall. It operates only on byte buffers in memory and the
  monotonic clock (for deadlines). It is **frozen** — byte-for-byte unchanged
  since Phase 0.
- **Public surface:** re-exported from `core::lib`. The model-facing pieces are
  `Connection`, `ConnAction`, `App`, `Server`, `ServerConfig`, and the
  setup-only helper `bind_listener`.
- **The one sanctioned exception** is `bind_listener` (`server.rs`): a *setup*
  helper that creates and binds a listening socket via `socket2`, including the
  `SO_REUSEPORT` path for `preforked` and `multireactor`. Binding and `listen()`
  are connection-*setup*, not per-connection I/O; no `read`, `write`, `accept`,
  or `epoll` lives in `core`.

### `server/src/sys/` — raw OS I/O

- **Owns:** thin, honest `libc` wrappers — `socket` (non-blocking sockets,
  `SO_REUSEPORT`), `poll`, `epoll` (level- and edge-triggered), `affinity` (CPU
  pinning), `signal` (SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown), `conn_table` (fd→connection
  slab), and `syscall` (retry/`EINTR` helpers). Every syscall in the project
  lives here.
- **Must never:** contain protocol or HTTP logic, and must not hide the semantic
  differences between mechanisms — `poll`, `epoll-lt`, and `epoll-et` stay
  distinct so the models can measure their difference. `sys` removes copy-pasted
  FFI and fd bookkeeping, nothing more.
- **Public surface:** one module per primitive (`affinity`, `conn_table`,
  `epoll`, `poll`, `signal`, `socket`, `syscall`).

### `server/src/reactor.rs` — event-loop assembly

- **Owns:** the epoll-ET readiness loop: an `epoll` instance plus a `ConnTable`,
  arming/disarming interest from each `ConnAction`, draining each socket to
  `EAGAIN`, managing `EPOLLOUT` for partial writes, and driving the
  `core::Connection` for every fd. `Reactor::new` builds it; `Reactor::run`
  runs it until the shared shutdown flag is set.
- **Must never:** select a model or own a concurrency policy. It is one reusable
  reactor; the `event-loop` model runs one of it on one thread, and each
  `multireactor` worker runs its own pinned instance over its own
  `SO_REUSEPORT` listener.
- **Public surface:** `Reactor`, `Reactor::new(...)`, `Reactor::run(&shutdown,
  &app)`.

### `server/src/models/` — the eleven strategies

- **Owns:** one concurrency/I-O strategy per module, each implementing
  `core::Server`. The blocking models share one serve loop (`blocking.rs`); the
  event-loop models share the `reactor`. A model owns *only* how readiness or
  completion is obtained and how work is dispatched.
- **Must never:** re-implement HTTP handling or copy-paste the serve loop. The
  only thing that varies between `iterative` and `io-uring` is the I/O strategy,
  not the protocol — that is what makes the benchmark a controlled comparison.
- **Public surface:** each model is a struct implementing `Server`; `main.rs`
  dispatches on the `--model` name.

## 3. The sans-IO rationale

A blocking accept-loop model and an `io_uring` completion model have nothing in
common at the I/O layer: one waits on a blocking `read`, the other reaps
completions from a ring. The only way one `core` can serve all eleven models
without modification is if `core` never touches a socket — so the protocol logic
consumes and produces byte buffers and reports intent (`WantRead` / `WantWrite`
/ `Close`), and the model performs the actual syscalls.

The concrete payoff is that blocking `read`/`write`, epoll readiness, and
`io_uring` completion all reuse one `Connection` state machine. The legacy repo
coupled parsing to `TcpStream` (`route_client(stream)`), which is precisely why
it could not extend past a blocking loop. `core` reintroduces no such coupling,
and the benchmark confirms the payoff three ways: the same machine drove blocking
I/O, epoll readiness, and `io_uring` completion, unmodified
(`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` §7).

## 4. Evidence — one frozen core served all eleven models

Every model below consumes the same unmodified `core::Connection`. `core` is
byte-for-byte unchanged since Phase 0; the I/O mechanism column is the *only*
axis that varies.

| Model | I/O mechanism | Consumes unmodified `core::Connection`? |
|---|---|---|
| iterative | Blocking serve loop, one connection at a time | Y |
| forking | Blocking serve loop in a per-connection `fork()` child | Y |
| preforked | Blocking serve loop in a fixed `SO_REUSEPORT` worker pool | Y |
| thread-per-conn | Blocking serve loop on a per-connection OS thread | Y |
| thread-pool | Blocking serve loop on a bounded worker pool | Y |
| poll | `poll(2)` readiness, non-blocking sockets | Y |
| epoll-lt | Level-triggered `epoll` readiness | Y |
| epoll-et | Edge-triggered `epoll` readiness, drain to `EAGAIN` | Y |
| event-loop | epoll-ET via the reusable `reactor` | Y |
| multireactor | Pinned per-core `reactor`, `SO_REUSEPORT`, shared-nothing | Y |
| io-uring | Single-ring completion: multishot accept, provided buffers | Y |

All eleven rows are Y. The blocking models drive `Connection` through the shared
serve loop, the readiness models through their epoll/poll loops, the event-loop
and `multireactor` models through the reactor, and `io-uring` feeds completions
into the identical `on_bytes` / `on_written` contract.

## 5. Connection lifecycle

`core::Connection` is the per-connection state machine every model drives. It is
sans-IO: the model performs all reads and writes; the connection consumes and
produces byte buffers and reports the next action via `ConnAction`.

```
model: accept() ─▶ Connection::new(read_timeout)             [Reading]
        │
        ├─ read bytes ───▶ conn.on_bytes(&buf, &app) ──▶ ConnAction
        │                     RequestParser.push(bytes)
        │                       Incomplete ─▶ WantRead         [Reading]
        │                       Complete   ─▶ App::handle ─▶ encode ─▶ WantWrite   [Writing]
        │                       Failed     ─▶ error Response ─▶ encode ─▶ WantWrite then Close
        │
        ├─ write bytes ──▶ conn.on_written(n) ──▶ ConnAction
        │                     drained + keep-alive ─▶ WantRead (deadline refreshed) [KeepAlive→Reading]
        │                     drained + close      ─▶ Close                          [Close]
        │
        └─ timer tick ───▶ conn.is_expired(now) ─▶ Close if true
```

| `ConnAction` | Meaning for the model |
|---|---|
| `WantRead`  | Wait for readability, then call `on_bytes(&buf, &app)`. |
| `WantWrite` | Write `pending_write()`, then report progress via `on_written(n)`. |
| `Close`     | Close the fd and drop the `Connection`. |

The contracts the state machine guarantees:

- **Sans-IO.** No syscalls; it reads only the monotonic clock for deadlines.
- **In-connection error responses.** On a parse `Failed`, `on_bytes` builds the
  error response (status from `ParseError::status()`), encodes it with
  `keep_alive = false`, and the post-write action is `Close`. The model never
  sees the error — it gets `WantWrite` then `Close`. This is the one-place fix
  for the legacy "one bad request kills the server" bug: an error is a normal
  response followed by a close, not a propagated `?`.
- **HEAD handling.** A `HEAD` response is encoded with `include_body = false` —
  correct headers and `Content-Length`, no body bytes.
- **Keep-alive + deadline refresh.** When `on_written` fully drains the response
  and the request wanted keep-alive, the connection resets its parser, returns
  to `Reading`, and refreshes the read deadline. Bytes that arrived past the
  current request are retained by `RequestParser::reset` so a pipelined request
  is not lost.
- **Timeouts.** `is_expired(now)` lets event-loop models drop a stalled
  connection on a timer tick; blocking models additionally rely on socket
  read/write timeouts. A slow client never pins a worker forever.

## 6. Key design decisions and rejected alternatives

Each decision states the alternative it rejected and the tradeoff accepted.

- **No async runtime / no tokio.** *Rejected:* building the models on `tokio` or
  `async-std`. *Reason:* the project measures I/O *mechanisms* — blocking,
  `poll`, level- and edge-triggered `epoll`, `io_uring` completion — and an async
  runtime would hide exactly the mechanism under study behind its own scheduler
  and reactor. `io_uring` uses the raw `io-uring` crate, never `tokio-uring`, for
  the same reason. *Tradeoff accepted:* more hand-written event-loop and lifetime
  code, in exchange for a controlled, mechanism-level comparison.

- **Shared-nothing `SO_REUSEPORT` over single-acceptor + fd handoff.** The
  kickoff brief sketched "one acceptor + N reactors." *Rejected:* a shared
  acceptor thread that accepts and hands fds to reactors over a queue. *Reason:*
  `SO_REUSEPORT` lets the kernel 4-tuple-hash connections directly to a
  per-reactor listener, removing the acceptor, the fd-handoff queue, and the only
  shared hot-path state. *Tradeoff accepted:* the kernel's hash balancing has no
  work-stealing, so skewed connection lifetimes can imbalance reactors
  (`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` §7, the `multireactor` caveat) — accepted because the
  benchmark confirms zero shared-state contention and the best C10K median of any
  model, p50 = 70 µs (`bench/results/c10k_multireactor.csv`), at 1.002
  ctx-switches/req on disjoint cores (`bench/results/profiles/summary.csv`).

- **`Vec` header store over `HashMap`.** *Rejected:* a `HashMap` keyed by header
  name. *Reason:* requests carry a handful of headers; a small linear-scanned
  `Vec` avoids per-request hashing and allocation and is faster at that size.
  *Tradeoff accepted:* O(n) header lookup, which is cheaper than hashing for the
  realistic header count and within the bounded `limits.rs` ceiling.

- **Provided buffer rings over per-read allocation (io-uring).** *Rejected:*
  posting a freshly allocated buffer with each read SQE. *Reason:* a provided
  buffer ring lets the kernel select the read buffer and report it in the CQE,
  which — with multishot accept — removes the per-accept and per-read submission
  syscalls and is what drives `io_uring` to 2.021 syscalls/req against
  epoll-et's 4.028 (`bench/results/profiles/summary.csv`). *Tradeoff accepted:*
  ring/buffer bookkeeping and tighter coupling to the kernel ABI, in exchange for
  the syscall-elimination the model exists to demonstrate.

- **Single-ring, single-thread io-uring scope.** *Rejected:* thread-per-core,
  multi-ring `io_uring` (the production form). *Reason:* a single ring on a
  single thread isolates syscall-elimination from core count, making the fair
  comparison single-ring `io_uring` vs single-thread `epoll-et`. *Tradeoff
  accepted:* this `io_uring` uses one core, so absolute-throughput leadership
  belongs to `multireactor` on N cores (`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` §8). On EPYC the
  single ring sustains a true C10K without shedding, but the AMD Zen4 pipeline
  data shows its halved syscall count does not out-execute epoll-ET (0.76 vs 1.20
  retired ops/cyc at C10K, `bench/results/profiles/perf_io-uring_c10k.txt`) — the
  syscall result it isolates holds on the apples-to-apples axis; the pipeline win
  does not follow on this frontend-latency-bound workload. Multi-ring `io_uring`
  is noted as future work, not built.

- **Bounded inputs enforced in the parser.** *Rejected:* trusting client input
  sizes. *Reason:* every ceiling in `limits.rs` (request-line, header, body,
  version) is enforced by the parser and mapped to an HTTP status (`414`, `431`,
  `413`, `505`), so an attacker cannot make the parser buffer unbounded input.
  *Tradeoff accepted:* a fixed refusal point on oversized but legitimate inputs,
  in exchange for slow-loris and memory-DoS resistance.
